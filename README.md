# Introduction

Welcome to my ecommerce website "The Shaurya Fitnness' - an online store for Workout clothing and accessories exclusively for women!! It is a B2C e-commerce website for the final project of the Code Institute diploma in Software Development.

The site provides role based permissions for users to interact with a central dataset. It includes user authentication, email validation and full CRUD functionality for approved users for Products.

The payment system uses Stripe. Please note that this website is for educational purposes only and the payment gateway is not set up to accept real payments. Do not enter any personal credit/debit card details when using the site.

When testing the site, please use the following from Stripe's testing documentation:

a Stripe test card number, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242, or 4000 0582 6000 0005 for UK.
a future expiry date, such as 04/26.
any three-digit CVC.
